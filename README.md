### **1.1 Motivation** <a href="#_uqybg5geeijp" id="_uqybg5geeijp"></a>

#### **Water Scarcity in Utah**

Utah, known for its stunning landscapes and arid climate, faces a growing and urgent challenge: water scarcity. This challenge affects both urban and agricultural areas, touching the lives of residents, businesses, and ecosystems alike. Water scarcity arises from a complex interplay of factors, including population growth, climate change, and inefficient or outdated water management practices

#### **Environmental Impact**

The consequences of water scarcity extend far beyond the immediate concerns of water availability. A critical environmental impact is the threat it poses to ecosystems, wildlife, and water-dependent industries. As water levels drop or increase, ecosystems struggle to survive, leading to habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity. Reduced water low in rivers and streams disrupts the natural balance, affecting fish populations and endangering species that relay on these water sources for survival. Water-dependent industries, such as agriculture and fisheries, are particularly vulnerable, facing diminished yields and economic hardship.

#### **Economic Implications**

In addition to its environmental toll, water scarcity carries significant economic implications. Agriculture, a cornerstone of Utahâ€™s economy, faces declining crop yields and increased operational costs as water becomes scarcer. Reduced water availability also impacts tourism, one of the stateâ€™s key economic drivers. Visitors are drawn to Utahâ€™s natural beauty, but dwindling water resources along with tourism threaten recreational opportunities, from boating on lakes to skiing in the mountains. Moreover, property values in areas grappling with water shortages may decline posing financial challenges for homeowners and local governments.

#### **The Need for Data**

In the face of these multifaceted challenges, data emerges as a critical linchpin in addressing water scarcity effectively. Comprehensive accurate, and accessible data is essential for understanding the dynamics of water resources, tracking usage patterns, and developing informed strategies for convseravation and sustainable management. Without reliable data, decision-makers are left in the dark, unable to enact policies and initiatives that could mitigate the impact of water scarcity.

The Wasatch Water Block (WWB) project arose as a response to this pressing need for data. By harnessing cutting-edge technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence, WWB offers a comprehensive solution to help manage, investigate, and share extensive water data from Utahâ€™s hydrologists, central watersheds, and nearby districts. Through WWB, we aim to empower stakeholders with the tools and information they need to address water scarcity, protect the environment, and secure the economic well-being of Utahâ€™s communities.
